# Fall of Vienna
*Fall of Vienna* (FoV) is an upcoming alternative history mod for *Victoria II*.

Points of divergence from real life:
- Ottomans conquer Vienna in 1683
- Sweden wins the Great Northern War
- Japan doesn't enter isolationist period
- Mexico successfully secedes from Mexico sometime in 1720

The mod is currently in alpha phase.

The [Fall of Viena Discord Server](https://discord.gg/JP62ZaTKgM) is the home for this mod. Please visit if you would like to discuss FoV, suggest improvements, or bring bugs to the attention of the developers.
